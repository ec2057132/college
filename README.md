Louis McGarry's Graded Unit Project Files and Setup
===================================================
In order to view a working version of the website designed with
the files provided there are a few things that need to be set up first.

#1 - Download all project files.<br>
#2 - Download a home server environment to run the application from
     (the local server solution used when developing this project was
     XAMPP).<br>
#3 - Add the website files to the local server's desired folder.
#4 - Login to the local server's phpMyAdmin page (or equivalent).
#5 - Import the database file onto the server through phpMyAdmin. 
     (Use this link to help import the server if needed:
     http://video.sc.su.ac.th/dashboard/docs/backup-restore-mysql.html).
#6 - Goto your brower and open the localhost's page to view the newly
     uploaded site!

If the website isn't connecting to the database then there is a chace the
connect_db.php file's detils don't match the server you're usings and will
need to be edited.
I recommend for ease of use you use XAMPP as these cridentials should
match what the website is looking for.

Thank you and please enjoy!
Louis
